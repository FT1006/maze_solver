# Maze Solver

A simple maze solving application built in Python that demonstrates basic pathfinding techniques. The project creates a maze, solves it using algorithmic approaches, and visualizes the solution.

## Overview

This application creates a window using a custom `Window` class, builds a maze with configurable dimensions, and uses a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., BFS or DFS) to solve the maze. The solution is then displayed on the screen until the user closes the window.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FT1006/maze_solver.git
   cd maze_solver
